AnÂ **acronym**Â is a type of abbreviation formed (**a shortened form of a word or phrase**) from the initial letters or initial sounds of words in a phrase. Acronyms are typically pronounced as full words, and they often consist of the first letters of each word in the phrase, usually written in all capital letters. For example, "NASA" stands for "National Aeronautics and Space Administration."

**The termÂ "deprecated"**Â refers to something that isÂ **no longer recommended for use**Â and may be consideredÂ **obsolete**Â orÂ **outdated**. In programming, it often indicates that a certain feature or element, such as a method or API, should not be used anymore, typically because it has been replaced by a better alternative. For example, in Java, theÂ `@Deprecated`Â annotation is used to mark elements that should no longer be used, signaling to developers that they may be removed in future versions.

In **async**, **concurrent** means:
> **Multiple tasks are in progress at the same time â€” but not necessarily running in parallel.**
### ðŸ”‘ Key ideas:

- **Concurrency** = Tasks take turns using resources (e.g., CPU, network)
    
- **Async** enables concurrency without blocking
    
- Tasks "wait" on I/O while others run
    
- Think of it as **interleaved execution**

The termÂ **"programmatically"**Â refers to doing something in a way that follows a specific plan or method, often through the use of code or programming.

- In general, it meansÂ **executing tasks via a program or script**Â rather than manually.
